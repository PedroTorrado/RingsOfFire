# RingsOfFire
The main objective of this program is to make a terminal based of Rings Of Fire
and also a version of it with a GUI
in order for it to be played in any situation ever if a deck of cards is not
available.  

GUI was made using PySimpleGUI and the final version will use PyInstaller
to turn it into an .exe file and usable without the use of neither the
terminal nor the necessary extensions to execute, so anyone can use the program.
